## Introduction {.smaller}  
### Study objective 

Analyze the relation between survival of patients with prostate cancer when given different treatments with estrogen and other relevant clinical parameters. 

Patients might be in different stages:

- Stage 3: No distant metastasis 
- Stage 4: Distant metastasis detected

Four used treatments:

- Placebo
- 0.2 mg diethylstilbestrol (DES)
- 1.0 mg DES
- 5.0 mg DES


## Materials & Methods {.smaller}
### Study data
- Study data was obtained from a randomized clinical trial https://biostat.app.vumc.org/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/prostate.xls
- The starting point for this project was a CSV file attached with the study.
- Dimention of the data:
<center>
![Reason of death](../doc/img/rawdataset.png){width=70%}
</center>
- 1 Column containing both numerical and categorical information ("0.2 mg estrogen").
- 1 Column containing info of patient status and death reason together ("dead - cerebrovascular").
- 27 NAs found in total.

## Data Cleaning and Augmenting {.smaller}
- Two datasets are joined into one by their patient IDs.
- Two columns are dropped (date on study and follow up time).
- All the columns are renamed.
- NAs in 4 different numeric columns replaced with their mean values.
- NAs in 1 categorical column are dropped (8 rows).
- New columns are created: dose, treatment, status, reasonDeath and reasonDeathNum

## Data Visualization (1/10) {.smaller}  
- There is 284 patients in cancer stage 3, and 210 in stage 4.
- There are no patients with cancer stage 1 or 2.

<center>
![Cancer stage](../results/04_plot_0.png){width=65%}
</center>

## Data Visualization (2/10) {.smaller}   
- Wit a higher cancer stage, we can see a skew to higher tumor sizes.
- This is expected since a tumor spreads to other tissues in an advanced stage.

<center>
![size vs stage](../results/04_plot_1.png){width=60%}
</center>

## Data Visualization (3/10) {.smaller}   
- Deaths caused directly by prostate cancer have a higher component by stage 4 tumors.
- Stage 4 characterize by spreading to more tissues and has a worse prognosis.

<center>
![Reason of death](../results/04_plot_2.png){width=60%}
</center>

## Visualizing our data (4/10) {.smaller} 
- Higher cancer stage, there is a higher measurement of acid phosphatase, a blood indicator related to prostate cancer.
- There is also a higher SG Index, which refers to histologic grade (well differentiated to undifferentiated).

<center>
![acid phosphatase and SG index](../results/04_plot_3.png){width=60%}
</center>

## Data Visualization (5/10) {.smaller} 
- In survival by dose of treatment, the only difference found was on 1 mg dosage.
- This difference was found only on stage 3 patients.

<center>
![Treatment vs survival](../results/04_plot_4.png){width=65%}
</center>

## Data Visualization (6/10) {.smaller} 
- The death rate decreases when the treatment dose is increased.
- A dose of 5 mg results in higher risk of cardiovascular problems.
- Therefore, a dose of 1 mg is recommended.

</center>

## Data Visualization (7/10) {.smaller} 
- Treatment results are not generally affected by age.
- Further analysis need to be done to assess the benefit of
the highest dose on the oldest group age.

<center> 
![survival vs age](../results/04_plot_6.png){width=80%} 
</center>

## Data Visualization (9/10) {.smaller} 
- Blood pressure (diastolic and systolic), dosage of treatment, and acid phosphatase levels where found to be non-significant for the survival rate.
- The most significant variables were bone metastases, history of cardiovascular disease and cancer stage.

- The manhattan plot corroborates the previous slides observations.

## PCA Analysis {.smaller} 
With the objective of getting a differentiation in the status (dead/alive), a PCA analysis was done to analyze attributes relevance and data distribution in space.

```{r image_grobs, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "50%", fig.align = "default"} 
knitr::include_graphics("../results/07_PCA_continuous.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../results/07_PCA_variance.png")
```

## PCA Analysis {.smaller} 

However, some information about the attributes that the PCA found to be more relevant are:

## K-mean Clustering {.smaller}    
- For k-mean clustering we used k = 2 (dead, alive).
- We excluded the variables found as non-significant.
- The model has an accuracy of ~60%.

## Discussion and conclussion {.smaller} 

- The models generated could not make a reliable prediction of the survival depending on the current variables in the dataset.
- There is a slightly better survival for 1 mg DES for stage 3 patients.
- The data suggest that the highest dosage of DES (5mg) have the lowest percentage for death by prostatic cancer but increases for heart or vascular complications.
