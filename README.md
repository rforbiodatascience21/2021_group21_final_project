# Group 21 - R for Bio Data Science Final Project


## Description

In this project, we analysed the prostate cancer data by using R programming skills, mainly with the tidyverse and ggplot2 packages, applied a PCA analysis and created shiny apps that allows us to present our findings in an elegant web app environment.



## Dataset

The dataset compares four treatments for patients with prostatic cancer in Stages 3 and 4, and it is described in the paper "Prognostic Variables for Survival in a Randomized Comparison of Treatments for Prostatic Cancer". 

It can be found in the project folder /data/_raw or downloaded from the link:
